# API-Code-Quiz-Challenge

I will resubmit this with the <div> issue resolved. I need help with restructing my <divs> because they are the main obstacle that prevents my app from working. The other elements should work; start button; result box; questions and answers; and local storage; but the HTML is preventing my script.js from working.
